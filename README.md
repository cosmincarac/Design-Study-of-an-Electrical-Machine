# Design Study of an Electrical Machine for the U.S. Department of Energy FreedomCAR 2020 project

__Intro__
 
This project represents my Final Year University Project, where I designed a high performance electric motor, which met the U.S. Department of Energy FreedomCAR 2020 project targets.

__Objectives__

The project objectives were:
1. Literature review of electrical machine design principles and equations 
1. Analytical model
   1. Create an analytical model based on machine design equations 
   1. Use the analytical model to get the initial sizing parameters of machine design
1. Finite element analysis
   1. Input initial sizing parameters from analytical model into Motor-CAD
   1. Validate analytical model
1. Sensitivity analysis
   1. Varying key parameters with an optimisation algorithm to improve the design 
1. Final electrical machine design
   1. Finalise a machine design based on information learned from the sensitivity analysis  
1. Final thesis
